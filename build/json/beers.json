In honour of those pioneering plague fighters we brew our mighty Black Plague Stout. A behemoth of near Imperial proportions, this dry Irish style stout is sure to convert even the most devoted drinkers of Ireland's most famous export. We start with Canadian two row barley, followed by loads of roast barley and oats, a light addition of Pacific Northwest Columbus hops and finish it off with some fresh liquorice root and decadent dark cocoa for a little chocolaty mouth feel. Brewed in small batches (even by our micro brewing standards), the result is a smooth, rich, roasty and always fresh stout sure to cure what ale's ya. This once seasonal favourite is available year round for you thirsty hoards looking to fend off the plague of boring beer.",

(and just the right amount of Twang!™)\n\nWe’re hoping you have a memory like a fish when it comes to this beer becuase we are intent on tweaking & experimenting every time we brew it.",
